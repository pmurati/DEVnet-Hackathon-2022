# DEVnet-Hackathon-2022

This repo contains the Jupyter notebook for the analysis of a medical cost dataset in the context of DEVnets internal hackathon 2022.

The data has been downloaded manually with a kaggle account (see links in the notebook's description). It lies in the `data` folder at the root of this directory.

To follow along, clone this repo and set up a virtual environment in the IDE of your choice. For example via

```bash
python -m venv .env
```

to create the folder `.venv`. Activate the virtual environment 

```bash
.env/Script/activate
```

and pip install the requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
